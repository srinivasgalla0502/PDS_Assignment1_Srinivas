## Explanation of Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Distribution of Math Scores
- **Description**: This histogram helps us understand the distribution of math scores among students.
- **Analysis**: It shows whether the scores are normally distributed or skewed. For example, if the histogram is left-skewed, it indicates that most students scored higher in math.


### Visualization 2: Average Scores by Gender
- **Description**: This bar chart compares the average math, reading, and writing scores between male and female students.
- **Analysis**: It helps identify gender-based performance differences. For example, if female students have higher average scores in reading and writing, it suggests a gender-based trend in performance.


### Visualization 3: Correlation Heatmap
- **Description**: The heatmap shows the correlation between math, reading, and writing scores.
- **Analysis**: It helps identify relationships between these subjects. For example, a high positive correlation between reading and writing scores suggests that students who perform well in reading also tend to perform well in writing.


### Visualization 4: Boxplot of Math Scores by Parental Education
- **Description**: This boxplot shows the distribution of math scores based on parental education levels.
- **Analysis**: It helps analyze how parental education impacts student performance. For example, if students with parents holding a master's degree have higher median math scores, it suggests a positive influence of parental education on student performance.


### Visualization 5: Scatter Plot of Reading vs. Writing Scores
- **Description**: This scatter plot helps visualize the relationship between reading and writing scores, with points colored by gender.
- **Analysis**: It helps identify trends and outliers. For example, if most points lie along a diagonal line, it indicates a strong positive relationship between reading and writing scores.
