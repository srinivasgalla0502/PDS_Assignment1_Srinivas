# Three-Stage Reproducible Workflow for Frailty Analysis

## Stage 1: Data Collection and Storage
- Collected raw data about female participants including Height, Weight, Age, Grip strength, and Frailty status
- Stored the raw data in CSV format in the 'raw_data' folder
- Created consistent naming conventions and documented the data sources

## Stage 2: Data Processing and Analysis
- Loaded the raw data from Stage 1
- Performed data validation and cleaning:
  - Checked for missing values
  - Converted categorical variables to binary format for analysis
  - Standardized numerical variables for comparative analysis
- Stored the processed data in the 'cleaned_data' folder

## Stage 3: Results and Visualization
- Performed correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables
- Created visualizations to illustrate key findings:
  - Correlation heatmap to show relationships between all variables
  - Box plot comparing grip strength between frailty groups
  - Scatter plot showing the relationship between age, grip strength, and frailty
- Stored results and visualizations in the 'results' folder
- Documented findings and analysis process

This workflow ensures reproducibility by:
1. Maintaining clear separation between raw data, processing steps, and results
2. Documenting each stage of the process
3. Using version control (GitHub) to track changes
4. Creating a well-defined folder structure
5. Using open-source tools and formats for maximum compatibility
